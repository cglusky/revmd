A Reverse Markdown Filter for Drupal

Use Case

Two way email integration is possible with Drupal using
-  Mailhandler
-  Mail2Web
-  Messaging
-  Notification

-  The Messaging module comes with two plain text filters, one of which uses Drupal core's
   drupal_html_to_text http://api.drupal.org/api/function/drupal_html_to_text/6 which is a close
   solution to what we are going to do here.  That function will be provide the framework for
   this filter module.  It's very close - We just need to tweak it to provide Markdown syntax

-  Drupal has a Markdown Filter Module for incoming email, but we need to be able to convert HTML
   back to Markdown for outbound emails.

-  This is largely to keep things consistent between input and output.

-  Apply this filter to outbound emails in the Messaging Module or use it elsewhere if it helps.

Due credit to all the great people who work in the Drupal Community as well as
John Gruber at Daring Fireball  http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
for Markdown in the first place.
